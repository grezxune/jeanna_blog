  <h1>12 Months of Resolutions!</h1>

<h3>Dec. 31, 2016</h3>

<p>Having a whole year to stick to a spur of the moment decision can be one of the hardest things to accomplish. I decided this year I am going to accomplish not 1 resolution, but 12.</p>

<p>I plan to do something new and different to me every month, for the whole month. For most things, this means doing it EVERY DAY that month. For others, it may be to finish something in a month.</p>

<p>Hopefully, by splitting up things I want to do throughout the year, will make them more attainable, and maybe I’ll continue to do some of them moving forward.
Here’s my list, in no particular order:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don’t eat out: this means cooking at home more, meal planning, and NO FAST FOOD!</p></li>
<li><p>Get rid of something: this means every day, I will pick something from the dark deep depths of my closet or storage space, and give it up. I can either donate it, re-gift it, or just simply trash it.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice a skill: I will by trying to practice a skill of mine for at least 1 hour a day. I am planning on this skill being pool, but we’ll see.</p></li>
<li><p>Hair &amp; Make-up: so, I am not one for makeup...or hair...My hair is either freshly showered and down au-naturale, or not so fresh, pulled up into a pile of knotted snakes on my head somewhere. I want to do my hair and makeup every day this month. This means no easy bun resting on my neck...that’s not “done.” I want to straighten, curl or style my hair somehow, everyday.</p></li>
<li><p>Dress up: Now this sort of goes with my last one, but I would like to split them up because doing them together, I think I may explode. So this means heels or boots every single day (I’m going to have stubs at the end of this one…) and no activewear as normal clothes...I am so guilty of wearing my gym clothes to work, it’s sad really…</p></li>
<li><p>Meditation: I have had an anxiety problem for a while now, and I keep getting told to meditate or practice breath exercises. So for this month, I will either follow a youtube meditation video or do yoga every single day this month.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn something: for years now I have ‘dabbled’ in sign language. My little cousin learned words growing up and I thought it was so cool. As I’ve aged, I’ve realised how useful sign language can be in everyday life. So I will find a class online or somewhere locally and commit to learning basic sign language and applying it everyday to make sure I remember it.</p></li>
<li><p>Picture a day: this is a cheezy one, but I’ve always wanted to try it. I’m no photographer but I see beautiful things every single day that I wish I could capture. I want to take a picture of something every day and upload it to a blog...speaking of blog, I want to start one of those too…</p></li>
<li><p>Start a blog: I have talked about this for years now and feel like I would really enjoy blogging. I love to write, I love to talk and I feel like I know some of the most interesting people, that I have lots of stories I’d love to share! I want to post to the blog every day. This may go in tandem with another month.</p></li>
<li><p>Create my website: My wonderful, amazing, talented, handsome and genius boyfriend helped me acquire a web domain name for myself to practice programming and things on. I would like this to eventually become my blog and a site in which I can show off my eventual programming skills that I used to create it.</p></li>
<li><p>Alcohol-free: Yup, this one’s gonna happen...of course, there’s never a good time to quit drinking it seems because every month there’s a reason to drink...but for 1 month this will happen...maybe February...seems easier…</p></li>
<li><p>Make art: This is one I will be good at-in the sense that I can do art everyday...but really really bad at-in that I cannot art...at all… For this month I want to either draw, paint, dye, sculpt, sing, make poetry or anything else I can try to art...I am open to suggestions.</p></li>
<li><p>Vegetarian time: I would say vegan, but I’m worried I’ll go broke and hungry...I plan to research this one a little more before I try it to see what it entails. I know cheese and eggs will still be a staple in my diet, but I need to learn about fish or seafood, as well as other forms of protein.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As I’m sure you noticed, there are more than 12 resolutions. This is because I want to make this as attainable as possible. If I feel like I can’t do one of these, I’ll have others to pick from and will be able to come back to ones that are more difficult for me.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole year I would like to set a goal. I want to save enough for a trip to Ireland. A all inclusive trip for 12 days to Ireland is about 2,000 bucks a person, so if I set aside $166.67 a month, I will have enough for a ticket. Of course there are always sales and deals so It may be less. I’ve wanted to travel there for a long time and seeing as I now have a stable job and a boyfriend who would love to see the world too, I want to make it happen.</p>

<p>So, for 2017 I have my sights set...and expectations misplaced...but I’m ready to try it! Hopefully I can inspire someone else to try some of these things as well, and who knows, maybe you or I will discover something about ourselves that we never knew!</p>
