   <title>Month One Resolution Update</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;What This Month&amp;#39;s Resolution Has Been Like So Far; And What&amp;#39;s to Come:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jan. 12, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve strayed a little bit from this month’s pick...BUT, it’s not about the number of times you fail, it’s about the number of triumph’s that follow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m getting back into reading the material I need to know in order to make my blog/website function, I just need to make sure I’m applying it as I go. So far I’ve downloaded Atom, a program that makes coding WAY easier, as well as keeps it very well organized. I’ve also settled on using Jekyll--it’s a blog specific coding site? Language? I’m still getting there. I’m  also becoming familiar with markdown language for the blog posts. They’re not pretty, but they’re there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve discovered that I am not cut out for the programmers life...There is no way anyone would hire me with an average of 46 WPM….while looking at my hands...6 WPM typing properly….That’s not a joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that’s only another thing about myself that I can strive to improve! Also, I’m only doing this to be knowledgeable of the mechanics behind programming and keeping up with a website/blog. So far, I’ve learned a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goals I still want to accomplish for this month’s resolution are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make my blog look nice:
I want it to be marketable-not that I’m trying to sell it-but I’d like it to be pleasant to look at, and have a general design.
Have my posts be linkable:
This means I can have interactive pieces and parts to some of my posts. For example: if I talk about how I’m learning how to make a blog with Jekyll, I can link to their website.
Have embedded Videos:
This is exactly what you think; video blogs. I want to be able to put a youtube video right on my page so you don’t have to go to a new website to watch something that I post.
Have a working contact page:
Yep, you can talk to me! I will be avoiding a comment section for now because I don’t think my little heart could handle it….but I would love to hear from people who have ideas for a blog, or just want to let me know they’re reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For next month, I’ve decided to do the Hair and Make-up  month. Now, I’ve been actually doing research on how to do my make up and what make ups are better, and what colors go with my features and whatever….and I’ve come to a couple conclusions, so here’s my pros and cons list….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros:
I’ll look pretty after I figure it out
It’s a new skill that I should have already known how to do…
The boyfriend will love it
It’s something else to talk about
Forces me to get into a better morning routine
Self esteem will go up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons:
Expensive
I’m going to hate my face without makeup
I’ll look like a clown until I get it down
Take a while to figure it out
Have to make time to do it in the morning
Make sure it’s all off at night
Dealing with acne
Going to the gym will be awful
Can’t touch my face like normal
The dreaded, “you look tired” or “are you sick?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I have more cons….makes me seem pretty closed minded...I’m really not, I swear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just something that I have never done before. I, like all girls had a makeup phase, but it lasted about 6 months and all I had was some crappy green and blue eyeshadow from Claire’s, and some eyeliner that I had NO idea how to use...so that didn’t go too well. I consider myself blessed because once that phase ended, I didn’t feel the need to wear makeup anymore. I was very confident with how I looked and never looked past that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that everyone who wears makeup is not confident in their own skin. Some people wear it because it’s fun for them, others because it’s an added expression to their look. I am excited to try it out for a month and I think I’ll be doing some different looks. Definitely going to try and keep it subtle during the day for work...I don’t need to scare anybody… but maybe in the evenings I can try some winged eyes, or colored eye shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The I Don't Care You Pick Date</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/01/04/the-i-don't-care-you-pick-date/"/>
   <updated>2017-01-04T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2017/01/04/the-i-don't-care-you-pick-date</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t care, you pick,&amp;quot; Date&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jan. 04, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging is what blogging does….annoying and tedious...and sometime annoying...and repetitive...I suppose annoying too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about a list of date ideas! I’m going to put these into a printable format so you can just print them off, cut them up, fold ‘em, and put em all in a jar to pick out of whenever you have no idea what to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these ideas came from my pinterest, or other blogs...that I had on my pinterest...so basically pinterest. Also, there is a cross over of seasons in the categories. Some are winter themed, and some can be done year-round. I have split them up into 3 categories: Free, Mid-cost (about $40 bucks or less) and Special Occasion (Usually more than 40 bucks, or takes more than half a day.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a little taste of what’s on those categories!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Free Date Ideas!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Learn to dance by following a youtube tutorial:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is sort of a sappy one, but you could make it fun! Find a salsa video and get steamy, or follow along and learn the Thriller dance together! Either way, this one is an awesome way to bond with your sweetie!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Color together:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a relaxing night in that is not hard to do. There are hundreds of thousands of free coloring book printables! Otherwise if you wanted, you can go to a local bookstore or even walmart, and pick up some “adult coloring books” to make it interesting ;) maybe do this one with a glass of wine cuddled up next to the fire place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to take this a step artsier, make it a paint night! Paint each other, or your pets, or anything...make sure you sign and frame your work, it could be worth something someday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Go disc golfing:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem  like a no brainer, but it is often overlooked. Disc golf is a great way to get outside, meet your step goal for the day (fitbitters, you know what I mean) and do something together! It’s free in MANY places, so no cost to you. And if you don’t have a disc, you can pick one up for less than 10 bucks at walmart. Otherwise we all know that one guy who’s trunk if full of them...just ask!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Homemade Boat Races:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a stream, small irrigation canal, or large gutter that has a nice flow of water. With aluminum foil or any other materials of your choice, form it into a boat. Choose a starting and ending point and 1-2-3- GO! Make a friendly wager if you’re into the competition, otherwise, work together to improve your boat and make it go faster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Medium Cost Date Ideas!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Wreck this Journal together!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the coolest “books” ever. (get it on amazon.com) You go through page by page and interpret what it says, and DO IT! Some of these involve going on finding objects to place, stick, rub or spit at parts of this book. By the time you complete the journal, you can go through and reminisce about how you “burned this page” or “covered this page in white things” or “dropped this book from a very high place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Just Drive:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get in the car and drive. Enjoy the face time together. The reason this isn’t in the “free” category, is because when you start to just meander in your car, you see things and places and you may want to stop. Don’t fight the urge! You might discover a new restaurant or a cute little town that you didn’t even know was there. Make a pit stop and eat, or have a drink (just one, unless you’re not driving.) By us, there are a LOT of cheese stores, and maple syrup shops--definitely a stop for me :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;DIY the Shit Out of Something:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gentlemen, I’m sure you’re in denial of your better 2/3rds pinterest, but it’s real, she does use it, and the things she pins, she does want to do. SO DO IT! Even if there’s nothing she has saved, search for something! Anything from making a bracelet out of an old baseballs stitches, to fabricating your own new headboard. Make something happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Pop Some Tags:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go thrift shopping together. Pick out an entire outfit for the other person-Then go out somewhere in that outfit! You can set a budget or talk about criteria before you just let loose in a shop with some of the most indescribable clothing you’ve ever laid eyes on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Special Occasion Date Ideas!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The 4 Courses:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dress to the nines, and pick a place to start. Get to a restaurant, order an appetizer. After you’re done, find a new place to have your dinner at, and again with dessert. The 4th course would be after dinner drinks or activities. Find a new place you haven’t tried before or have always wanted to see the inside of. Enjoy :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Minute to Win It:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is thrown in here as an alternative to just a couple date. Invite other couples, and have a fun game night. Minute to Win It is a TV game show where contestants have 60 seconds to complete, what seems like, an easy task. Example: get 10 ping pong balls out of a kleenex box. The catch? The box is connected to your butt, and you can’t use your hands….Could be super fun with couples!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Like I said, these are just a small taste of the ideas I have on the whole list. Please feel free to download the printable version and use these in your home! The highlighted ones are ones that may be seasonal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have questions on an explanation, just make up your own, or feel free to contact me with questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your dates!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>So I Decided To Start Blogging</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/01/02/so-I-decided-to-start-blogging/"/>
   <updated>2017-01-02T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2017/01/02/so-I-decided-to-start-blogging</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;So, I decided to Start Blogging&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jan. 02, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this month, I’ve decided to start blogging, and here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It keeps me honest:
I, along with millions of others I’m sure, and the type to get motivated about something, and go for it really hard...for about 2 weeks….then it dwindles away like that last reming prepubescent pimple on your chin that only stayed there forever because you kept picking the damn thing. Having a blog will force me to talk about my success and failures, and seeing it written down for the world to see, will make me want to make sure that I’m keeping up with my goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps me become a better writer:
Writing has always been something I’ve felt like I was pretty good at, considering that was 50% of my college major. I like to be goofy and I love to tell stories, and blogging is a neat outlet for that. After all, in an office setting I can’t really talk about that thing I did in that place with my best friend in high school when we both really had to….nevermind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It keeps me focused:
Blogging has a bad rap altogether, at least that’s what I’ve noticed. Especially with the recent memes of; person-”I killed a spider with a boot.” blogger-”let me tell you how I almost lost the fight of life today against a poisonous animal!” It’s hard to take it seriously today, but I want to stay focused on being an entertainer through my works, as well as keeping things real. I have goals I want to meet during this experiment, and I plan to meet them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is an outlet for whatever I want:
Have a problem with someone in town? Blog. Did you just spend 40 minutes waiting for a train with no way out and had some crazy cool stories pop into your head during that time? Blog. Maybe your pet passed away and you just don’t want to stop talking about it, but feel bad for making your boyfriend or best friend listen to you non-stop for 4 days? Blog. Have a family member who somehow outshines you regardless of their failures, poor life choices, awful hygiene, cheated education and constant need to validate himself in anyway possible even if it means putting others sanity on the line!!!! Blog motherfucker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a form of being social:
I’d be lying if I said I was the anti-social type. I’ve always been outgoing and quirky, and I love to meet new people. Seriously I do...so much so, that I will talk to anyone that looks like they’re not going to kill me….and sometimes I accidentally talk to people who actually almost kill me...but that’s a story for another time. Regardless of my in person ability to make friends and start conversations, it has always been interesting to me to see the online community come together to answer questions, write reviews, discuss hot button topics, or just to collaboratively complain about how scary it is when you lean back just barely too far in your chair and have that mini heart attack...yeah, horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for those reasons, I’ve decided to start blogging. Hopefully I get some interest, but if not, I’ll keep writing to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My First Blog</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2016/12/31/my-first-blog/"/>
   <updated>2016-12-31T00:00:00-06:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;12 Months of Resolutions!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dec. 31, 2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a whole year to stick to a spur of the moment decision can be one of the hardest things to accomplish. I decided this year I am going to accomplish not 1 resolution, but 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to do something new and different to me every month, for the whole month. For most things, this means doing it EVERY DAY that month. For others, it may be to finish something in a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, by splitting up things I want to do throughout the year, will make them more attainable, and maybe I’ll continue to do some of them moving forward.
Here’s my list, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t eat out: this means cooking at home more, meal planning, and NO FAST FOOD!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get rid of something: this means every day, I will pick something from the dark deep depths of my closet or storage space, and give it up. I can either donate it, re-gift it, or just simply trash it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practice a skill: I will by trying to practice a skill of mine for at least 1 hour a day. I am planning on this skill being pool, but we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hair &amp;amp; Make-up: so, I am not one for makeup...or hair...My hair is either freshly showered and down au-naturale, or not so fresh, pulled up into a pile of knotted snakes on my head somewhere. I want to do my hair and makeup every day this month. This means no easy bun resting on my neck...that’s not “done.” I want to straighten, curl or style my hair somehow, everyday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dress up: Now this sort of goes with my last one, but I would like to split them up because doing them together, I think I may explode. So this means heels or boots every single day (I’m going to have stubs at the end of this one…) and no activewear as normal clothes...I am so guilty of wearing my gym clothes to work, it’s sad really…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meditation: I have had an anxiety problem for a while now, and I keep getting told to meditate or practice breath exercises. So for this month, I will either follow a youtube meditation video or do yoga every single day this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn something: for years now I have ‘dabbled’ in sign language. My little cousin learned words growing up and I thought it was so cool. As I’ve aged, I’ve realised how useful sign language can be in everyday life. So I will find a class online or somewhere locally and commit to learning basic sign language and applying it everyday to make sure I remember it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picture a day: this is a cheezy one, but I’ve always wanted to try it. I’m no photographer but I see beautiful things every single day that I wish I could capture. I want to take a picture of something every day and upload it to a blog...speaking of blog, I want to start one of those too…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start a blog: I have talked about this for years now and feel like I would really enjoy blogging. I love to write, I love to talk and I feel like I know some of the most interesting people, that I have lots of stories I’d love to share! I want to post to the blog every day. This may go in tandem with another month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create my website: My wonderful, amazing, talented, handsome and genius boyfriend helped me acquire a web domain name for myself to practice programming and things on. I would like this to eventually become my blog and a site in which I can show off my eventual programming skills that I used to create it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol-free: Yup, this one’s gonna happen...of course, there’s never a good time to quit drinking it seems because every month there’s a reason to drink...but for 1 month this will happen...maybe February...seems easier…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make art: This is one I will be good at-in the sense that I can do art everyday...but really really bad at-in that I cannot art...at all… For this month I want to either draw, paint, dye, sculpt, sing, make poetry or anything else I can try to art...I am open to suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegetarian time: I would say vegan, but I’m worried I’ll go broke and hungry...I plan to research this one a little more before I try it to see what it entails. I know cheese and eggs will still be a staple in my diet, but I need to learn about fish or seafood, as well as other forms of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’m sure you noticed, there are more than 12 resolutions. This is because I want to make this as attainable as possible. If I feel like I can’t do one of these, I’ll have others to pick from and will be able to come back to ones that are more difficult for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the whole year I would like to set a goal. I want to save enough for a trip to Ireland. A all inclusive trip for 12 days to Ireland is about 2,000 bucks a person, so if I set aside $166.67 a month, I will have enough for a ticket. Of course there are always sales and deals so It may be less. I’ve wanted to travel there for a long time and seeing as I now have a stable job and a boyfriend who would love to see the world too, I want to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for 2017 I have my sights set...and expectations misplaced...but I’m ready to try it! Hopefully I can inspire someone else to try some of these things as well, and who knows, maybe you or I will discover something about ourselves that we never knew!&lt;/p&gt;
