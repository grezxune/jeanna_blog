  <h1>So, I decided to Start Blogging</h1>

<h3>Jan. 02, 2017</h3>

<p>So, this month, I’ve decided to start blogging, and here’s why:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It keeps me honest:
I, along with millions of others I’m sure, and the type to get motivated about something, and go for it really hard...for about 2 weeks….then it dwindles away like that last reming prepubescent pimple on your chin that only stayed there forever because you kept picking the damn thing. Having a blog will force me to talk about my success and failures, and seeing it written down for the world to see, will make me want to make sure that I’m keeping up with my goals.</p></li>
<li><p>It helps me become a better writer:
Writing has always been something I’ve felt like I was pretty good at, considering that was 50% of my college major. I like to be goofy and I love to tell stories, and blogging is a neat outlet for that. After all, in an office setting I can’t really talk about that thing I did in that place with my best friend in high school when we both really had to….nevermind.</p></li>
<li><p>It keeps me focused:
Blogging has a bad rap altogether, at least that’s what I’ve noticed. Especially with the recent memes of; person-”I killed a spider with a boot.” blogger-”let me tell you how I almost lost the fight of life today against a poisonous animal!” It’s hard to take it seriously today, but I want to stay focused on being an entertainer through my works, as well as keeping things real. I have goals I want to meet during this experiment, and I plan to meet them!</p></li>
<li><p>It is an outlet for whatever I want:
Have a problem with someone in town? Blog. Did you just spend 40 minutes waiting for a train with no way out and had some crazy cool stories pop into your head during that time? Blog. Maybe your pet passed away and you just don’t want to stop talking about it, but feel bad for making your boyfriend or best friend listen to you non-stop for 4 days? Blog. Have a family member who somehow outshines you regardless of their failures, poor life choices, awful hygiene, cheated education and constant need to validate himself in anyway possible even if it means putting others sanity on the line!!!! Blog motherfucker.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s a form of being social:
I’d be lying if I said I was the anti-social type. I’ve always been outgoing and quirky, and I love to meet new people. Seriously I do...so much so, that I will talk to anyone that looks like they’re not going to kill me….and sometimes I accidentally talk to people who actually almost kill me...but that’s a story for another time. Regardless of my in person ability to make friends and start conversations, it has always been interesting to me to see the online community come together to answer questions, write reviews, discuss hot button topics, or just to collaboratively complain about how scary it is when you lean back just barely too far in your chair and have that mini heart attack...yeah, horrifying.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, for those reasons, I’ve decided to start blogging. Hopefully I get some interest, but if not, I’ll keep writing to myself.</p>
